# Architecture styles

We use the term *architecture style* to mean a family of architectures that share certain characteristics. *N-tier application* and *microservices application* are examples of architecture styles. 

An architecture style is an abstraction that defines high-level concepts and a shared vocabulary. For example, an N-tier architecture includes the concept of a *tier*, and a microservices architecture includes  the concept of a *microservice*. Shared concepts and vocabulary make it is easier to understand and reason about the architecture.

The choice of an architecture style does not dictate a particular technology. However, certain technologies are more naturally suited for some architectures. For example, container orchestrators are a natural fit for microservices architectures. So the choice of architecture style informs the choice of technologies. 

**Architecture styles as constraints**. The high-level concepts in an architecture style impose a set of constraints on the architecture. These contraints guide the design and create a "shape." The hope is that by conforming to these constraints, certain desirable properties will emerge. Therefore itâ€™s important to understand not just the constraints (the "shape" of the architecture) but the motivation behind them.

## Catalog of architecture styles

- Big compute
- Big data
- CQRS
- Event driven
- Microservices
- [N-tier](./n-tier)
- [Web-queue-worker](./web-queue-worker.md)

For each architecture style, we include the following:

- A description of the architecture.
- A logical diagram showing the important parts of the architecture.
- Recommendations for when to choose this architecture style, including benefits and challenges.
- A diagram showing a recommended deployment of this architecture, including the relevant Azure services and resources.
